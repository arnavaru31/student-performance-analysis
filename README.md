                                                                  Student Performance Analysis
                                          A Python project that generates a synthetic dataset of student scores and visualizes performance trends.
                                               It demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.



                              Features

-Generates a dataset of student attributes (gender, parental education, test prep, etc.) and scores (Math, Reading, Writing).

-Performs basic data analysis (summary statistics, dataset info).

Visualizes:

-Distribution of scores (histograms).

-Score comparisons by gender (boxplots).

-Average scores by parental education (barplot).

-Impact of test preparation courses (barplot).

-Correlation matrix between subjects (heatmap).


    Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn



  How to Run:

  Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Run the script:

analysis.py

(every run generates different data since it's synthetic)
